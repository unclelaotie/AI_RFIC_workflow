# AI_RFIC_workflow

`AI_RFIC_workflow` is a research workflow for pixelized RFIC layout automation on top of Keysight ADS / RFPro.

It covers the full chain:

1. generate or edit pixel-layout JSON templates
2. create ADS workspaces, libraries, cells, layout views, and `rfpro_view`
3. run EM simulations and export Touchstone / CSV / ADS datasets
4. convert layout and EM results into HDF5 datasets
5. train a PyTorch CNN surrogate model that predicts EM responses directly from layout tensors

The repository is publishable and the main technical flow has been runtime-validated, but it still reflects a research workflow rather than a polished end-user product.

## Platform Support

The project now supports both **Windows** and **Linux** platforms:

- **Windows**: Original support maintained (PowerShell environment variables)
- **Linux**: Full support for Keysight ADS on Linux (bash environment variables)
- **macOS**: Partial support (ADS availability may vary)

📖 **For Linux users, please read [LINUX_SETUP.md](LINUX_SETUP.md) for setup instructions.**

```

## Recommended Mainline

The recommended public execution line is:

1. `Data_process/JSON_layout_create/`
2. `parallel_version/`
3. `Data_process/HDF5_create/`
4. `Pytorch_Model/`

`serial_version/` should be treated as legacy/reference material only.

## Role Of Layout JSON Generation

`Data_process/JSON_layout_create/` is the upstream layout-template generation stage of the repository.

It is responsible for turning pixelized RFIC layouts into structured JSON inputs that are later consumed by:

- `parallel_version/` for ADS / RFPro automation
- `Data_process/HDF5_create/` for dataset construction

In practical terms, the layout generator and its GUI tools let a user:

- define multi-layer pixel matrices
- place ports on layout borders
- save or batch-export reusable layout JSON files
- create randomized layout variants for data generation

For first-time quickstart users, this stage is optional because the repository already includes sample JSON inputs under `parallel_version/config_examples/json_layout/`.

For real dataset production and long-term use, this stage is essential because it is the source of the layout templates that drive the rest of the workflow.

## Runtime Model

This repository uses two different Python contexts.

### 1. ADS Automation Host

Use a normal Python interpreter for the outer CLI/orchestration layer.

- This can be a standard `venv`, Conda environment, or system Python.
- It does not need `torch` or `scikit-rf`.
- It launches the ADS-installed Python for ADS-specific work.

**Environment Variables (required):**

Linux:
```bash
export ADS_PYTHON=/opt/Keysight/ADS/tools/python/python3
export ADS_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/Keysight/ADS
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:ADS_PYTHON = "C:\Keysight\ADS\tools\python\python.exe"
$env:ADS_INSTALL_DIR = "C:\Keysight\ADS"
```

You can also start from:

- [`.env.example`](.env.example) - Copy to `.env` and edit with your paths

**Optional Environment Variables:**

Linux:
```bash
export PDK_DIR=/home/user/PDK/pdk_2024
export PDK_TECH_DIR=/home/user/PDK/pdk_tech_2024
export SUBSTRATE=microstrip_substrate
```

Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:PDK_DIR = "C:\PDK\pdk_2024"
$env:PDK_TECH_DIR = "C:\PDK\pdk_tech_2024"
$env:SUBSTRATE = "microstrip_substrate"
```

### 2. HDF5 / PyTorch Host

Use a separate Python environment for HDF5 creation, training, and verification.

Install packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Important:

- do not install repository ML dependencies into the ADS internal Python runtime
- ADS-internal Python is only for Keysight modules invoked by the automation layer
- `requirements.txt` is for the HDF5 / ML environment

See [ENVIRONMENTS.md](docs/reference/ENVIRONMENTS.md).

## What Has Been Validated

Validated on March 10, 2026:

- `parallel_version/` single-sample workflow: passed
- `parallel_version/` 3-sample parallel batch workflow: passed
- `Data_process/HDF5_create/create_hdf5.py`: passed on real generated `.s2p` files
- `Pytorch_Model/src/train.py`: passed with smoke and retraining runs
- `Pytorch_Model/src/tools/verify_model.py`: passed with a current 2-channel checkpoint

Validation evidence and compatibility notes:

- [RUNTIME_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md](docs/maintenance/RUNTIME_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md)
- [MODEL_DATA_COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/reference/MODEL_DATA_COMPATIBILITY.md)
- [RETRAIN_2CH_CHECKPOINT.md](docs/maintenance/RETRAIN_2CH_CHECKPOINT.md)

## Key Constraints

- end-to-end execution requires Keysight ADS / RFPro, valid licenses, and an accessible PDK or reference technology library
- Supported platforms: Windows (primary), Linux (experimental)
- large HDF5 datasets and model checkpoints are intentionally not tracked by Git
- a historical 1-channel checkpoint exists only as a local legacy artifact and should not be treated as the canonical current model
